App to create notes
==========
The main target of this app is creating notes as cutting parts from e.g. online lessons
Not every time we can copy text to note, or we want to remember some graph what teacher
shows as. 
I'm build this app because I'm doing a lot of photos during online classes.
And I had big messed.
