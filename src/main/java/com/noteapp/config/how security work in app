I will change Basic to Jwt token

first i will full remove old configure

Place to store token:

1. backend:
- Entity UserToken: username, token, age of token.
2. frontend:
- LocalStore
3. If user will logged token will be in everyone request headers

Login:
1. backend:
- Create UserToken and add to database.
2. frontend:
- LocalStore

Filter
session will not exist on backend so i need to create filters to verification token
1. one pre request
check header jwt is fine
    if yes add username to request or user with will be useful to endpoint and dochain
    If no clear token to this user on data base and reddit to login page e.g.

authorization filter will be on OAuthor


session frontend
cause i need e.g. user name to load navbar property i must to create endpoint to take this data.
